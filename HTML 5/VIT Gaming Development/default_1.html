    <h2>About Gaming Industry</h2>
    <p>By 2026, there will be more than 300 billion video games in use worldwide.
     With billions of dollars in revenue and more than 2.5 billion gamers worldwide, 
     we can anticipate that game platforms will continue to develop in 2019 and beyond. 
     In addition to the industry's steady and outstanding expansion, 
     it is interesting to note that there has recently been a change in the gaming sector's
     revenue sources. The majority of the gaming industry's revenue used to come from the
     sale of games, but that has changed in recent years.
